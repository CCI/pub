    Abstract = {Berkeley UNIX 4.2BSD offers several choices for interprocess communication. To aid the programmer in developing programs comprising cooperating processes, the different choices are discussed and a series of example programs are presented. These programs demonstrate in a simple way the use of pipes, socketpairs, and sockets and the use of datagram and stream communication.}
