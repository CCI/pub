  There are many APIs for connecting and exchanging data
  between network peers.  Each interface varies wildly based on metrics including performance,
  portability, and complexity.  Specifically, many interfaces make
  design or implementation choices emphasizing some of the
  more desirable metrics (e.g., performance) while sacrificing others
  (e.g., portability).  As a direct result, software developers
  building large, network-based applications are forced to choose
  a specific network API based on a complex, multi-dimensional set
  of criteria. Such trade-offs inevitably result in an interface that
  fails to deliver some desirable features.

  In this paper, we introduce a novel interface that both supports
  many features that have become standard (or otherwise generally
  expected) in other communication interfaces, and strives to export a
  small, yet powerful, interface.  This new interface draws upon years
  of experience from network-oriented software development best
  practices to systems-level implementations.  The goal is to create a
  relatively simple, high-level communication interface with low
  barriers to adoption while still providing important features such
  as scalability, resiliency, and performance.  The result is the
  Common Communications Interface (CCI): an intuitive API that is
  portable, efficient, scalable, and robust to meet the needs of
  network-intensive applications common in HPC and cloud computing.
