  Striving for performance or portability, complexity or simplicity,
  multiple API for exchanging data between peers are available
  today. While each of them has interesting and unique features,
  developers using them to build more complex software
  infrastructures, found points where the API failed to
  deliver critical features required in today's complex software
  development environment. 

  In this paper we introduce a novel API, based on features already
  available on other communication API, which expose a minimalistic
  interface while allowing the upper levels to take advantage of a
  significant number of features. We based the proposed API on
  requirements from our diverse backgrounds, thriving to keep the high
  level complexity at a minimum. In this paper we prove that
  portability, and simplicity at the API level, while providing
  scalability and robustness are features that can be provided by a
  communication library with a minimal impact on the performance of
  the underlying communication protocol. As such, we expect such an
  interface to facilitate the development of new network hardware,
  minimize the overhead imposed on the host operating system while
  allowing application and library developers to reach two of the
  most challenging requirement for the dynamic distributed tomorrow's
  applications: minimize the latency and maximize the bandwidth,
