With the advent of ubiquitous networking and the Internet
Protocol~\cite{ip-rfc-xxx} 
% IP is the important part here -- not TCP / UDP.  Not advent or modern.
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) / Unreliable Datagram Protocol
(UDP) providing connectivity across a diversity of hardware
architectures and system software stacks, the need for a ubiquitous
communication API providing application portability has been
acute. The widely used BSD Sockets API has largely fulfilled this
role, supporting a variety of underlying networking technologies
through the TCP/UDP abstraction of the lower level interface. Since
the standardization of TCP~\cite{tcp-rfc-675} in 1974 and
UDP~\cite{udp-rfc-768} in 1980 and the socket API that supported these
protocols, networking technologies have made substantial
strides. Early networking technologies supported by TCP/UDP such as
10BASE5 Ethernet, Token Ring, and Token Bus technologies with
multi-millisecond latencies, have been replaced by technologies such
as 10GBase-SR and Quad Data Rate (QDR) InfiniBand (IB), Cray's Gemini,
IBM's Torrent, and SGI's NumaLink with latencies as low as 1$\mu$s.

Current generation networking technologies provide advanced features
such as supportf for remote direct memory access (RDMA) OS bypass,
zero copy, one-sided operations, asynchornous operations,

% sockets provides basic support and t obfuscates other underlying functionality
the stream-based API of Sockets obfuscates and often
negates the benefits of these features. In response, a number of
next-generation network APIs have been proposed, such as the Virtual
Interface Architecture (VIA), OpenFabrics Verbs, Myrinet eXpress (MX),
and the Portals API. While adequately exposing the underlying network
interface's capabilities, none of these network APIs has garnered the
support from application developers that the Sockets interface
has. Two key barriers exist to widespread adoption of many of these
APIs, simplicity from an application developer perspective, and
portability (including performance portability) across a variety of
networking technologies.

Application developers are currently forced to make substantial
tradeoffs in the selection of an underlying networking API for their
distributed applications. The use of Sockets virtually guarantees
portability across a wide range of operating environments but may
substantially limit performance and scalability. The use of a custom
networking API may satisfy performance and scalability requirements
but exposes the application to limited portability and may implicitly
remove flexibility in future infrastructure procurements. As a growing

number of applications in the area of internet search technologies,
cloud computing, financial trading and rich media require the
scalability and performance once reserved for high-performance
computing applications, the need for an API that addresses both
portability and performance is acute.

In this paper we propose a new networking API known as the Common
Communication Infrastructure (CCI) that balances the needs of
portability and simplicity while preserving the performance
capabilities of current and next-generation networking
technologies. In developing CCI we have drawn upon our prior
experience with a variety of low-level networking APIs as well as our
experience in working directly with application developers in the use
of these APIs. We strive, wherever possible, to adhere to our primary
goal of simplicity in order to foster wide-spread adoption while
maintaining performance and portability. The remainder of this paper
is organized as follow.  Section~\ref{sec:state} depicts the
state-of-the-art of the common messaging APIs, followed by a section
describing our designs goals.  In Section~\ref{sec:interface}, we
details the CCI entities, endpoints and connections, as well as the
API. Finally, we present the current implementation performance over
UDP and Portals low level interfaces, and then conclude the paper.
